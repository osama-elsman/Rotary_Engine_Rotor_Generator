Epitrochoid Geometry Calculator for Rotary Engines
This MATLAB script calculates the epitrochoid geometry for rotary engines based on the values of eccentricity and the rotor area required.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the R_Calculator_GUI.m file.
Open the file in MATLAB.
Usage
Run the R_Calculator_GUI function in MATLAB.
Enter the values of eccentricity and rotor cross sectional area required in the text boxes provided.
Click the "Calculate R" button to calculate the value of R and plot the resultant curve.
Click the "Export to Excel" button to export the x and y values to an Excel file.
Examples
Here's an example of how to use the R_Calculator_GUI function:

Open MATLAB and run the R_Calculator_GUI function.
Enter a value of 0.5 for eccentricity and a value of 100 for rotor area required.
Click the "Calculate R" button to calculate the value of R and plot the resultant curve.
Click the "Export to Excel" button to export the x and y values to an Excel file.
